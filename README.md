Web application to generate `config.gateway.json` files for Ubiquiti Security Gateways.  Most users will just want to take a look at the running instance, available at https://stati.cflo.at/usg_generator for the time being.  Note that there has been absolutely no effort put into making the UI beautiful, but you can click on some things like the IPv6 provider prefxes or the `curl` command in order to auto-fill/copy to clipboard.
